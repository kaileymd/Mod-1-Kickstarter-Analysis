I have several recommendations for Louise based on the data.
*Start your project in June, as you can see in the above chart.
*Lower your fund goal to be at or below $2,000. The data shows that the range for funded projects almost never exceeds that amount.
*Make sure to have the highest quality page descriptions and worthwhile perks you can offer.

## Conclusion
The data provided has shown that starting your project in June and having a goal around $2,000 will statistically increase your chances of funding your project. Putting effort into your project descriptions and perks will avoid the typical downfalls of failed projects, which receive little - if any - money at all.

Thanks for your time Louise, and good luck on your musical.
