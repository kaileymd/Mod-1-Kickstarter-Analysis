# Kickstarting with Excel

## Project Overview
So you want to crowdfund your dream project - now what? This project will delve into Kickstarter campaign data to discover any relevant trends to help you make your project a success.

### Purpose
This analysis will look at the performance of projects in the 'Theater' category, including plays, musicals, and theater spaces, to provide insight and actionable takeaways to make *Fever*, Louise's play, a possibility. Louise is an upcoming playwright who anticipates needing $10,000 to fund *Fever*.

## Analysis and Challenges
What makes up a Kickstarter? According to the [Kickstarter Creator Handbook](https://www.kickstarter.com/help/handbook?ref=rules), there are several parts that can be summarized as:
* The Project
* The Funding Goal
* Promotion and Rewards

This analysis will focus on Project and Funding Goal data trends.

### Timing is Everything
To focus our scope, let's look at when Kickstarter theater projects are launched compared to how successful they are:

While there is an overall increase in total theater projects in Quarter 2, there is a significant spike in successful theater projects that launched in May and June. Particularly in contrast to the dismal outcomes of projects launched in Quarter 4, this suggests launching in May or June will increase the likelihood that your project will succeed.

### Money, Money, Money
Now for the hardest part: convincing strangers on the internet to give you money to fund your dream. To account for different types of theater projects requiring different budgets, we limited the data to show *only* plays. This is a tough crowd - projects that asked for more than $5,000 were more likely to fail than to succeed.
